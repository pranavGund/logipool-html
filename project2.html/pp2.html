    <h3>Online Shopping Information</h3>
    <pre>
        Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows
        consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over
        the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers 
        find a product of interest by visiting the website of the 
        retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors
        using a shopping search engine, which displays the same 
        product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers.
        As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of
        different computers and devices, including desktop
        computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.
