    <pre>Audi is one of the best-selling luxury automobile 
        manufacturers in the world. However, the origins of
        the German brand are complex and colourful, to say the least.

        Behind the name of every car company, there’s a story. Sometimes
        it’s as simple as the name of the family who founded it
        (Bentley, for example), sometimes it’s an acronym for a phrase 
        people don’t seem to remember. The story behind Audi, however, 
        is that little bit more interesting. OSV takes a look at the rich 
        history of the German brand in our Audi history.</pre>
